# BookLibrary
Project created using the MEAN stack frameworks.
How it works:
1. Into the empty boxes, type in required text about a book and then click add it add it to the database
2. Once it has been added, you may select the book by click on its row on the table
3. Once selected you may click on buttons to interact with it such as edit, update, delete, issue, or return.
4. Issue will increment the amount of books issued by 1 and create a transaction
5. Return will decrement the amount of books issued by 1 and create a transaction
6. Delete will remove it permanently from the database
7. Edit will place the information in the text boxes however you can only affect the number of books by changing the value.
8. After the changing the value, click on the update button to make the change in the database.
9. There is a button on the type right corner for Transaction list which is in a seperate view.
10. Transaction has the same functionality except delete and can be edited entirely.
11. The transaction page also has a button to return to the book list page on the top right corner.
